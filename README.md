A collaborative analysis of smoking and drug use trends (2020-2024), with an interactive dashboard showing analysis across age groups, examining factors like peer influence, media impact, and parental supervision, empowering stakeholders to implement targeted health and prevention strategies.

**OBSERVATIONS ON YOUTH SMOKING AND DRUG USE TRENDS (2020 – 2024)**

**GENERAL TRENDS AND METRICS**

1. Mental Health Trends (2020–2024): A decline in average mental health scores was observed from 2020 (5.54) to 2022 (5.40), followed by a recovery peaking at 5.52 in 2023. However, it slightly dipped again to 5.47 in 2024. This indicates fluctuating mental health trends among youth over the years.

2. Smoking Prevalence by Age Group: Smoking is most prevalent in the 25–29 age group (28.7%), with notable decreases in prevalence among younger and older age groups. Youth aged 20–24 (27.8%) also show high smoking rates.

3. Drug Experimentation by Age Group: Experimentation is consistent across most age groups, with youth aged 15–24 showing higher engagement compared to older age groups.


**SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES**

4. Media Influence by Age Group: Media has the highest influence on the 15–19 age group, decreasing with older age groups. This suggests that targeted media campaigns may disproportionately impact younger demographics.

5. Peer Influence by Gender: Peer influence is higher among females (19K) compared to males (18K), though the difference is marginal.

6. Parental Supervision by Gender: Supervision is balanced, with males receiving slightly higher supervision (35.7%) compared to females (34.2%).

7. Access to Counseling by Age Group: Counseling access increases progressively with age, peaking in the 25–29 age group (1K). Youth in younger age groups (15–19) may require increased focus on counseling opportunities.
